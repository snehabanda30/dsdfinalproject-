# DSDFinalProject : COLLECT 

# Introduction (Pre)


# Attachments: (Pre)
### A description of the expected behavior of the project, attachments needed (speaker module, VGA connector, etc.), related images/diagrams, etc. (10 points of the Submission category)
* The more detailed the better â€“ you all know how much I love a good finite state machine and Boolean logic, so those could be some good ideas if appropriate for your system. If not, some kind of high level block diagram showing how different parts of your program connect together and/or showing how what you have created might fit into a more complete system could be appropriate instead.

# Process Summary (Sneha)

# Important Port Maps 
### Description of inputs from and outputs to the Nexys board from the Vivado project (10 points of the Submission category)
  * As part of this category, if using starter code of some kind (discussed below), you should add at least one input and at least one output appropriate to your project to demonstrate your understanding of modifying the ports of your various architectures and components in VHDL as well as the separate .xdc constraints file.
